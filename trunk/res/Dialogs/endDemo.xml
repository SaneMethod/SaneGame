content="Hey, congrats, you've reached the end of the alpha tech demo. 'WHAT!' You say. 'That's IT!?' Yep. For now. However,
I've made this fairly open-system. Anyone can make maps for this game! I hope to have a community of dedicated map-makers. Maybe 
you'd like to be a part of it? The tools needed will soon all be made freely available. I look forward to seeing what you make of 
my game! Yours Truly, Christopher Keefer."
