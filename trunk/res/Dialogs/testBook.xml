	word-wrapped by my fancy algorithm! Pretty neat, huh? The only thing I have to be careful of is to leave 
	a blank space at the end of what appears to be a line, so that the necessary whitespace token is found. 
	Also, I probably ought to limit myself as to how much text is written in each entry, or the whole screen 
	could end up covered in it." texture="" proceed="++"

	is! Guess! Okay, I'll tell you... test purposes! YAY! Wow... This can't really work on the first try, can it?
	You mean, I don't have to spend the next hour tinkering with it? It's just going to work right off the bat?
