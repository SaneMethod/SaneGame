Began sketching out program flow. Began work on basic classes. Reproduced some work from previous projects.

Codified method of accessing system resources from XML files. Finished creating Font graphic files. Codified system-wide Constants.
Finished Parser classes for accessing XML for System resources. Achieved run-window at 60 fps, displaying Glyphs.

Wrote a word-wrap routine based on the 'Greedy Algorithm', with a specific implementation operable with a number of
different pre-defined fonts - namely, those I created earlier. Encapsulated within the Text object class, which can be
called to draw itself to the screen. Will become part of the XML parsed Dialogs that will allow me to simply parse any
dialog at will from an XML file, have the parser create the text object and pass that back, and then draw the text object.
Worked for an hour on XML parser for text object, about half finished.

Finished XML parser for text. Considering adding Options tag to XML, to allow user to follow decision trees in the text. Worked
on text box implementation using a OpenGL shape and a gradient fill. Considering using an expandable image texture instead.

Finished Animated Text box and letter-by-letter text display. Finished text box display using an expandable texture directly rendered
by OpenGL to the screen context. Added two different ways to instantiate, update and display text objects. Created configurable text
display speeds. Began work on main menu.

Added Options Tag to Dialog XML standard (kText.dtd). Created Options class (extending Text class). Class now automatically parses a
given content for a specific delimiter (@@) to define where one option ends, and another begins. Also, a caption can be added to the
beginning of the Option text that isn't selectable, but rather instructs the user what to do, or informs he what he is choosing, etc.
Also, the select box will automatically resize itself to the option, allowing the option to span multiple lines if necessary. Also
created the ability to move a select box and choose an option to the class.

Altered kText.dtd standard to incorporate a proceed field, which will contain information on whether to bo to the
next Text object in the dialog, the previous one, or one specified by name, once the display of the current one is
completed. Added code to the Pull Parser to handle this field, and to the Text/Option class as well.

Created TextHandler class, which abstracts away the gritty operations of the Text objects - now, a state need only
call a very few functions from the TextHandler class in order to perform the necessary display, update and input
handling processes.

Started work on the Entity set of classes, which will eventually contain all the necessary classes for the
creation, maintenance, movement, properties etc. of all moveable objects, all non-player sprites, and the
Player sprite.
