Wrote a word-wrap routine based on the 'Greedy Algorithm', with a specific implementation operable with a number of
different pre-defined fonts - namely, those I created earlier. Encapsulated within the Text object class, which can be
called to draw itself to the screen. Will become part of the XML parsed Dialogs that will allow me to simply parse any
dialog at will from an XML file, have the parser create the text object and pass that back, and then draw the text object.
Worked for an hour on XML parser for text object, about half finished.

Finished XML parser for text. Considering adding Options tag to XML, to allow user to follow decision trees in the text. Worked
on text box implementation using a OpenGL shape and a gradient fill. Considering using an expandable image texture instead.
