objects out of thin air and duplicate yourself. Like I said, totally Sane. Press A to advance this dialog."

content="This is a type of game known as a PLATFORMER, so it involves shooting everything that... no, just kidding. It mostly involves 
non-violent activites like jumping from platform to platform, with the occasional critter to squash by jumping on its head."

content="In order to jump, press the c button. Depending on how long you hold the c button down, you'll jump higher, up to a maximum height. Normally,
you can't jump once you're in the air - what would you jump off of? But we're not always entirely sane here in Sane - sometimes, a
particular item might let you jump in the air... Once you've got the hang of jumping, press A to continue."

content="You'll notice the nearby ball. It has certainly noticed you. ITS WATCHING YOU... *ahem*. In order to grab the ball (and teach 
it a lesson in manners) hold down the v key and run into it. You'll automatically grab it, and hold on to it for as long as you hold
down the v key."

content="As soon as you release the v key, you'll let go. You can run and jump while holding something, but depending on how
heavy what you're holding is, you might run or jump more slowly than usual, so keep that in mind."

content="Further to your right is a trampoline. If you jump on it, it'll propel you upwards. If you drop something on it, that object 
will also be propeled upwards. You can even hold on to something and jump on the trampoline, but again, you'll not go as high, depending 
on the weight of what you're holding."

content="Well... wow, thats pretty sad. Also, you should notice a red block on the ceiling nearby. You'll also notice a coin or two within reach. Here's your first little trick...
If you grab the coins, you'll be able to spend one on inverting the gravity by pressing g."

content=" BE CAREFUL! Each inversion costs one coin, and if you spend them all and haven't reached the exit yet, you'll have to start again. If you do mess up, pressing r on any map will
reset you back to the beginning, or to the last waypoint you have reached."

<Text type="rec" name="waypoint" font="standardFont" colour="16711680" boxed="true"
content="You can see a Waypoint near you - you may have already stumbled over it, in fact. It looks like a furled flag post when 
inactive, and the flag is unfurled when you've triggered the waypoint. The most recent waypoint you've triggered is the one you'll
return to, so be careful if you backtrack on a map not to trigger an earlier waypoint!"

<Text type="rec" name="coins" font="standardFont" colour="16711680" boxed="true"
content="As for the coins, you can spend them on your tricks, but they also serve as your 'lifepoints'. Whenever you get hit by an 
enemy, or fall from a great height, you'll lose one coin. If you lose a coin when you don't have any, you'll die, and have to restart
the level from the beginning, or the last waypoint you reached."

you'll soon be free to proceed. OR SO IT WOULD SEEM! When you step off, the wall returns! Maybe if you put something on the switch, 
it'll keep the wall from returning..."

<Text type="rec" name="tenth" font="standardFont" colour="16711680" boxed="true"
content="Now if you're past the wall, you'll be noticing the blue orb floating in the air. That's the EXIT ORB! Yes, I've got this
whole naming thing down. When you touch that orb, you'll be quickly transported to the next map. Congratulations, you've 
completed the tutorial! Enjoy the game. You ought to, it took me long enough to make - not that I'm bitter. Oh no. NOT BITTER!
Yours truly, Christopher Keefer."
