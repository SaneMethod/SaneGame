	word-wrapped by my fancy algorithm! Pretty neat, huh? The only thing I have to be careful of is to leave 
	a blank space at the end of what appears to be a line, so that the necessary whitespace token is found. 
	Also, I probably ought to limit myself as to how much text is written in each entry, or the whole screen
