	word-wrapped by my fancy algorithm! Pretty neat, huh? The only thing I have to be careful of is to leave 
	a blank space at the end of what appears to be a line, so that the necessary whitespace token is found. 
	Also, I probably ought to limit myself as to how much text is written in each entry, or the whole screen 
	could end up covered in it." texture="" proceed="++"

	a button), it will wrap back around to the first text we displayed!@@
	This is option two. It goes on to some un-boxed text that eventually wraps round to the beginning again!@@
	This is option three! It's super duper long on purpose. Guess what the purpose is! Guess! Okay, I'll tell you... 
	test purposes! YAY! Wow... This can't really work on the first try, can it?
	You mean, I don't have to spend the next hour tinkering with it? It's just going to work right off the bat?
	Weird. But AWESOME! :)@@This is option four! It leads to some more text, which then ends this Dialog!"
